# Useful tools repository

So I don't have to keep Googling the same thing over and over again

1. Clone this repo to your local computer:

```shell
$git clone git@github.com:huijing/tools.git
```

2. Install the necessary packages for this repo:

```shell
$ npm install
```

3. Run **Gulp** to concatenate and compile files:

```shell
$ gulp
```

- Styles go in the `styles.scss` file, and will be compiled by Gulp
- Scripts go into the js folder, and will be concatenated by Gulp
